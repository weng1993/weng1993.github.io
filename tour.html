<h1>Vincent H. Weng </h1>
<div id="meu">
<p>Hello! My name is Vincent. I am a local-born-and-raised Hangzhouese. A fellow traveler myself, I feel sympathetic for the frustration many get in an unfamiliar country, especially where the international hostels don't do much to help. I offer inexpensive, highly personalized private tours in my spare time for travelers in need. Partly I am also doing this to save up for a trip in Europe. <p>

	<p>I am a car, a driver, a proficient translator, a loyal friend who is genuienly interested in getting to know you and helping you, and a guide that knows how to help you get most out of your stay in this beautiful city of Hangzhou. I love this city too much that want to take you to my favorite places (in the correct time). <p>

<p>
In the past I have taken peace-lovers to serene tea village and maintounous buddhist temple , art-lovers to art museum to appreciate the profound eastern art, and food-adventurer to experience exotic cuisine.<p>

<p>
I believe that life is about new experiences, and the most part of that is about making connections with random people. Thank you for viewing this page. Add me on wechat, call me or email if you need a tour, if you want some advice, or just want to say hi. You are more than welcome to be my guest. Ciao!<p>
